<h1> üëã Hello there, I‚Äôm @LucianaCHA \(‚ó¶'‚å£'‚ó¶)/</h1> 

I¬¥m Luciana, pasionated about puzzles and  learning new stuff.That's what drew me to software development, and I've been hooked ever since.

I find software development to be an amazing field, and I'm always looking to learn as much as I can so I can apply that knowledge to solve problems and create solutions for businesses. That's why I decided to study, and in May 2022, I graduated from Henry's Bootcamp as a Full Stack Developer!

At Henry academy I¬¥ve learn many technologies wich were applied and integrated in my individual project : Pokemon App. Finally, for my graduation project I colaborated with 4 students designing and developing from 0 a full functional e-commerce : The Marvel Comics App .

During my time at Henry's Academy, I learned many different technologies and applied them to my individual project, the Pokemon App. For my graduation project, I collaborated with four other students to design and develop a fully functional e-commerce platform: The Marvel Comics App. It was an exciting and challenging project, and I learned a lot about working in a team, project management, and using technologies to build real-world applications.

Overall, my time at Henry's Bootcamp was an incredible experience that helped me grow both personally and professionally. I'm excited to continue my journey in software development and see where it takes me next!
